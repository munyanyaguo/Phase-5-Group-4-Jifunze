# üîß Backend URL Fix - RESOLVED

## Problem Identified

Your backend at `https://jifunze-31gc.onrender.com` **IS working** and **HAS data**, but we were calling the wrong endpoints!

### The Issue
- ‚ùå We were using: `https://jifunze-31gc.onrender.com/api/courses`
- ‚úÖ Should be using: `https://jifunze-31gc.onrender.com/courses`

Your backend has routes at the **root level**, not under `/api` prefix.

## Data Verification ‚úÖ

**Schools Endpoint:**
```bash
curl https://jifunze-31gc.onrender.com/schools
```
Returns: 3 schools, 746 students, 55 teachers ‚úÖ

**Courses Endpoint:**
```bash
curl https://jifunze-31gc.onrender.com/courses
```
Returns: 4 courses, 176 enrolled students ‚úÖ

**Health Check:**
```bash
curl https://jifunze-31gc.onrender.com/health
```
Status: Healthy ‚úÖ

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated `.env.production`
```bash
# Before (WRONG):
VITE_API_URL=https://jifunze-31gc.onrender.com/api

# After (CORRECT):
VITE_API_URL=https://jifunze-31gc.onrender.com
```

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions
File: `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`
- Changed `VITE_API_URL` from `/api` suffix to root URL

### 3. Updated `render.yaml`
- Changed `VITE_API_URL` environment variable

### 4. Updated `.env.example`
- Documentation now shows correct URL

## Backend Route Structure

Your backend has these working endpoints:

### Root Routes (‚úÖ Working)
- `/health` - Health check
- `/schools` - List schools
- `/courses` - List courses
- `/students` - Student data
- `/attendance` - Attendance records
- `/messages` - Messages
- `/dashboard/stats` - Dashboard statistics
- `/resources` - Learning resources

### API Routes (‚ö†Ô∏è Not Used)
- `/api/*` - These exist but return errors

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   # Start local dev server
   npm run dev
   
   # Should now connect to: https://jifunze-31gc.onrender.com
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: correct backend API URL (remove /api suffix)"
   git push
   ```

4. **Verify After Deployment**
   - Visit: https://phase-5-group-4-jifunze.onrender.com
   - Login should work
   - Data should load

## Database Status

- **Type**: SQLite (demo mode)
- **Status**: Connected ‚úÖ
- **Data**: Present ‚úÖ
  - 3 schools
  - 746 students
  - 55 teachers
  - 4 courses
  - 176 enrollments

## Summary

‚úÖ **Backend is working perfectly**  
‚úÖ **Data is present and accessible**  
‚úÖ **URLs have been corrected**  
‚úÖ **Ready to deploy**

The issue was simply using `/api` suffix when the backend routes are at root level!
