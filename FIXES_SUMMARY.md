## ‚úÖ Backend Fixes Completed

### 1. Registered Missing Manager Endpoints
Added three new endpoints in `/server/app/routes/__init__.py`:

```python
# Manager-specific endpoints
api.add_resource(EducatorsByManagerResource, "/manager/educators")
api.add_resource(ManagerStudentsResource, "/manager/students")
api.add_resource(ManagerUsersResource, "/manager/users")
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
Added try-catch blocks with detailed error messages to all three manager resources in `/server/app/routes/schools.py`:
- `EducatorsByManagerResource` (line 530)
- `ManagerStudentsResource` (line 560)
- `ManagerUsersResource` (line 644)

## üìã API Endpoints Now Available

### Manager Endpoints (require JWT authentication + manager role)

1. **GET `/api/manager/educators`**
   - Returns all educators across manager's schools
   - Response: `{ "educators": [...] }`

2. **GET `/api/manager/students`**
   - Returns all students across manager's schools
   - Response: `{ "students": [...] }`

3. **GET `/api/manager/users`**
   - Returns all users across manager's schools
   - Response: `{ "users": [...] }`

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Start the Backend Server:
```bash
cd server
pipenv run flask run
# or
/home/chei/snap/code/205/.local/share/virtualenvs/server-KvOtOS2S/bin/flask run
```

### Frontend Pages Using These Endpoints:
1. **Dashboard** (`/owner/dashboard`) - Shows stats and school overview
2. **Educators** (`/owner/educators`) - Lists all educators, uses `/api/manager/educators`
3. **Students** (`/owner/students`) - Lists all students, uses `/api/manager/students`
4. **Courses** (`/owner/courses`) - Lists courses, uses `/api/manager/educators` for educator dropdown
5. **Users** (`/owner/users`) - Lists all users, uses `/api/manager/users`

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Login as a manager/owner user
- [ ] Navigate to Dashboard - should display stats cards with animations
- [ ] Navigate to Educators page - should fetch and display educators
- [ ] Navigate to Students page - should fetch and display students
- [ ] Navigate to Courses page - should load courses and educator dropdown
- [ ] Navigate to Users page - should display all users
- [ ] Check browser console for any remaining errors
- [ ] Verify animations are working (cards should fade in)

## üêõ Known Issues & Next Steps

### If you see 500 errors:
1. Check Flask server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify JWT token is valid in localStorage
3. Ensure the logged-in user has "manager" role
4. Check database has schools owned by the manager

### If pages are blank:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify the backend server is running on port 5000
3. Check CORS headers are correct (already configured for localhost:5173)
